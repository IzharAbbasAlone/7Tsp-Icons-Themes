# 7Tsp-Icons-Themes
7Tsp icon themes for Windows as well as some extras. Please read the guide prior to installation

To install this icon pack you need to use [7TSP GUI 2019 Edition](https://github.com/AlisIzhar).

Installation: Open up 7TSP & click Add a Custom Pack & select the icon pack you want to install. Click on Start Patching. By default 7TSP will create a restore point & install the icon pack. Once installation is complete reboot & you're done.

Requirements: ***Windows 10 Builds 1903 - Windows 11 current builds.***

For a cleaner look use the [Folder Thumbnail Remover](https://github.com/AlisIzhar/7Tsp-Icons-Themes/blob/main/Folder%20Thumbnail%20Remover/Folder%20Thumbnail%20Remover.zip) registry hack.
